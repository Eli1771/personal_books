# Specifications for the Sinatra Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Use Sinatra to build the app
  - Used the sinatra gem to create the app and build most of the files. I even kept most of the CSS and layout.erb content

- [X] Use ActiveRecord for storing information in a database
  - Uses ActiveRecord throughout. All my controller actions use methods and attributes generated by ActiveRecord

- [X] Include more than one model class (e.g. User, Post, Category)
  - I have a fairly cumbersome 7 models in this one, one is just a join table for the many-to-many relationship between books and author

- [X] Include at least one has_many relationship on your User model (e.g. User has_many Posts)
  - Uses several has_many relationships, most importantly: User has_many Books

- [X] Include at least one belongs_to relationship on another model (e.g. Post belongs_to User)
  - Uses several belongs_to relationships, most importantly: Book belongs_to User

- [X] Include user accounts with unique login attribute (username or email)
  - User is initialized with a unique username and password. Passwords secured with the Bcrypt gem and has_secure_password method

- [X] Ensure that the belongs_to resource has routes for Creating, Reading, Updating and Destroying
  - You can create, read (with several view options) edit and delete books from the lib/book/:id/edit path

- [X] Ensure that users can't modify content created by other users
  - Helper methods in controller prevent users from editing, deleting or even viewing content created by other users

- [X] Include user input validations
  - Form action prevents submission if certain fields are left blank, and if a user tries to put books on shelves that don't exist on a given bookcase

- [X] BONUS - not required - Display validation failures to user with error message (example form URL e.g. /posts/new)
  - When a controller action redirect a user either because the user isn't signed into the proper account or because the user tried to submit a form that was not filled out properly, the controller uses Flash messges to display detailed errors on the proper page. There are some success messages that use flash to display as well

- [X] Your README.md includes a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code
  - Readme has all required fields, and uses the MIT liscense

- [X] You don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message
